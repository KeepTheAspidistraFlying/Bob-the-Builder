Using Machine Learning/ Logistic Regression

 Hey Guyz;
 
 so this is kinda easy but it can be a very good exercise if ure a beginner in ML.
 
Task:

ure given a feature matrix & a single datapoint to predict.(0 or 1)

build a Logistic Regression model with features & predict the datapoint.

the first few lines are:

n=int(input());
X=[];

for i in range(n):

  X.append([float(x) for x in input().split()]);
  
y=[int(x) for x in input().split()];

datapoint=[[float(x) for x in input().split()]];
